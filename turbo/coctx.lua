--- Couroutine context helper class.
-- This class is used to help tie yields in Turbo RequestHandlers together 
-- with waiting for events to become available. The class act as a reference 
-- for both the user and the IOLoop to tie suspended coroutines together with
-- actual async operations. Typical usage would be:
--
-- function MyHandler:get()
--     local response, error = coroutine.yield(
--          turbo.async.HTTPClient:new():fetch("http://myjson.org"))
--     .... do stuff with response when it is ready without blocking ....
-- end
--
-- The HTTPClient class function fetch returns a CoroutineContext instance. 
-- The coroutine.yield will halt execution of the function and return the 
-- CoroutineContext from 'fetch'.  The IOLoop will keep a reference to the 
-- returned CoroutineContext together with the suspended coroutine. This list 
-- is not iterated on every IOLoop iteration so it is relatively cheap to have
-- thousands of yielded RequestHandlers at once. When the HTTPClient class 
-- internals has handled the request (or failed to do so), it will trigger a 
-- coroutine resume with the parameters stored in the CoroutineContext via a 
-- callback placed on the IOLoop by matching the CorutineContext by reference.
-- Only the IOLoop will know anything about suspended coroutines.
-- Lua Coroutines are not OS threads and are purely implemented in the Lua 
-- interpreter, and as such are very cheap to create, suspend and destroy. 
-- Yielding can be done from anywhere that the IOLoop:add_callback() has been
-- used to place a function on the IOLoop. However the yield must, either 
-- return a CoroutineContext or a function. A yielded function will simply be
-- resumed on next iteration of the IOLoop. The yielder is free to yield again.
-- This class is NOT EXCEPTION/ERROR safe, and should not raise any errors as 
-- they are unhandled, and will cause the program to exit!
