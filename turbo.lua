--- Turbo.lua Asynchronous event based Lua Web Framework.
-- It is different from all the other Lua HTTP servers out there in that it's
-- modern, fresh, object oriented and easy to modify.
-- It is written in pure Lua, there are no Lua C modules instead it uses the
-- LuaJIT FFI to do socket and event handling (only applies for Linux).
-- Users of the Tornado web server will recognize the API offered pretty quick.
--
-- If you do not know Lua then do not fear as its probably one of the easiest
-- languages to learn if you know C, Python or Javascript from before.
--
-- Turbo.lua is non-blocking and a features a extremely fast light weight web
-- server. The framework is good for REST APIs, traditional HTTP requests and
-- open connections like Websockets requires beacause of its combination of
-- the raw power of LuaJIT and its event driven nature.
--
-- What sets Turbo.lua apart from the other evented driven servers out there,
-- is that it is the fastest, most scalable and has the smallest footprint of
-- them all. This is thanks to the excellent work done on LuaJIT.
--
-- Please visist http://turbolua.org to report issues or ask questions.
--
--
-- Main features and design principles:
--
-- * Simple and intuitive API (much like Tornado)
--
-- * Good documentation
--
-- * No dependencies, except for LuaJIT the Just-In-Time compiler for Lua.
--
-- * Event driven, asynchronous and threadless design
--
-- * Extremely fast with LuaJIT
--
-- * Written completely in pure Lua
--
-- * Linux Epoll support
--
-- * Small footprint

-- The Turbo Web version is of the form A.B.C, where A is the major version,

-- is zero, it’s omitted from the version string.
-- When a new release only fixes bugs and doesn’t add new features or
-- functionality, the micro version is incremented. When new features are
-- added in a backwards compatible way, the minor version is incremented and
-- the micro version is set to zero. When there are backwards incompatible
-- changes, the major version is incremented and others are set to zero.
