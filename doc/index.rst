This is the documentation for Turbo.lua version 1.0.0.

Introduction
------------
Turbo.lua is a Lua module / toolkit (whatever) for developing web applications in Lua. It is different from all the other Lua HTTP servers out there in that it's modern, fresh, object oriented and easy to modify. No pun intended!
It is written in pure Lua, there are no Lua C modules instead it uses the LuaJIT FFI to do socket and event handling. Users of the Tornado web server will recognize the API offered pretty quick.
If you do not know Lua then do not fear as its probably one of the easiest languages to learn if you know C, Python or Javascript from before.

Turbo.lua is non-blocking and a features a extremely fast light weight web server. The framework is good for REST APIs, traditional HTTP requests and open connections like Websockets requires beacause of its combination of the raw
power of LuaJIT and its event driven nature.

What sets Turbo.lua apart from the other evented driven servers out there, is that it is the fastest, most scalable and has the smallest footprint of them all. This is thanks to the excellent work done on LuaJIT.

Its main features and design principles are:

- Simple and intuitive API (much like Tornado)

- Good documentation

- No dependencies, except for the Lua interpreter.

- Event driven, asynchronous and threadless design

- Extremely fast with LuaJIT

- Written completely in pure Lua

- Linux Epoll support

- Small footprint
