turbovisor -- Application supervisor
************************************

Turbovisor is an application management tool which detects file changes and restart application on the fly.  There are several parameters to control its behavior.

Options
~~~~~~~
\-w, --watch
  Specify files or directories to watch.  If directory is given, all its sub-directories will be monitored as well.  By default, turbovisor will monitor current directory.
\-i, --ignore
  Specify files or directories to ignore.  If directory is given, all its sub-directories will be ignored as well.  This is uesfull for auto-generated files or temporary files.  By default, no file is ignored.
