.. highlight:: lua

Preliminaries
=============
All modules are required in turbo.lua, so it's enough to

::

   local turbo = require('turbo')
	
All functionality is placed in the "turbo" namespace.

Module Version
==============
The Turbo Web version is of the form *A.B.C*, where *A* is the
major version, *B* is the minor version, and *C* is the micro version.
If the micro version is zero, it's omitted from the version string.

When a new release only fixes bugs and doesn't add new features or
functionality, the micro version is incremented. When new features are
added in a backwards compatible way, the minor version is incremented
and the micro version is set to zero. When there are backwards
incompatible changes, the major version is incremented and others are
set to zero.
	
The following constants specify the current version of the module:

``turbo.MAJOR_VERSION``, ``turbo.MINOR_VERSION``, ``turbo.MICRO_VERSION``
  Numbers specifiying the major, minor and micro versions respectively.

``turbo.VERSION``
  A string representation of the current version, e.g ``"1.0.0"`` or ``"1.1.0"``.
  
``turbo.VERSION_HEX``
  A 3-byte hexadecimal representation of the version, e.g.
  ``0x010201`` for version 1.2.1 and ``0x010300`` for version 1.3.

Object oriented Lua
===================
Turbo Web are programmed in a object oriented fashion. There are many ways to do 
object orientation in Lua, this library uses the Middleclass module. Which is documented
at https://github.com/kikito/middleclass/wiki. Middleclass is being used internally in 
Turbo Web, but is also exposed to the user when inheriting from classes such as the
``turbo.web.RequestHandler`` class. Middleclass is a very lightweight, fast and very
easy to learn if you are used to Python, Java or C++.


turbo.web namespace
======================
turbo.web namespace provides a web framework with asynchronous features that allow it
to scale to large numbers of open connections.

Create a web server that listens to port 8888 and prints the canoncial Hello world on a GET request is
very easy:

.. code-block:: lua
   :linenos:

	local turbo = require('turbo')

	local ExampleHandler = class("ExampleHandler", turbo.web.RequestHandler)
	function ExampleHandler:get() 
		self:write("Hello world!") 
	end

	local application = turbo.web.Application:new({ 
		{"/$", ExampleHandler}
	})
	application:listen(8888)
	turbo.ioloop.instance():start()


RequestHandler class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The RequestHandler class are implemented so that it must be subclassed to process HTTP requests.

*Subclass a RequsetHandlerr class and reimplement any of the following methods to handle the corresponding HTTP method, if a request method that is not implemented is recieved the requester will get a 405 (Not Implemented) status code:*

.. function:: RequestHandler:get(...)	
	
	HTTP GET reqests handler.
        
        :param ...: Parameters from matched URL pattern with braces. E.g /users/(.*)$ would provide anything after /users/ as first parameter.

.. function:: RequestHandler:post(...)

	HTTP POST reqests handler.
        
        :param ...: Parameters from matched URL pattern with braces.

.. function:: RequestHandler:head(...)

	HTTP HEAD reqests handler.
        
        :param ...: Parameters from matched URL pattern with braces.

.. function:: RequestHandler:delete(...)

	HTTP DELETE reqests handler.
        
        :param ...: Parameters from matched URL pattern with braces.

.. function:: RequestHandler:put(...)

	HTTP PUT reqests handler.
        
        :param ...: Parameters from matched URL pattern with braces.

.. function:: RequestHandler:options(...)

	HTTP OPTIONS reqests handler.
        
        :param ...: Parameters from matched URL pattern with braces.

All of these methods recieves the arguments from the patterns in the ``turbo.Web.Application`` handler section.

*Candidates for redefinition:*

.. function:: RequestHandler:on_create(kwargs)

	Reimplement this method if you want to do something straight after the class instance has been created.
        
        :param kwargs: The keyword arguments that you initialize the class with.
        :type kwargs: Table

.. function:: RequestHandler:prepare()

	Called before each request, independent on the HTTP method used for the request..

.. function:: RequestHandler:on_finish()

	Called after the end of a request. Useful for e.g a cleanup routine.

.. function:: RequestHandler:set_default_headers()

	Reimplement this method if you want to set special headers on all requests to the handler.

*Stream modifiying methods:*

.. function:: RequestHandler:write(chunk)

	Writes the given chunk to the output buffer.			
	To write the output to the network, call the ``turbo.web.RequestHandler:flush()`` method.
	If the given chunk is a Lua table, it will be automatically
	stringifed to JSON.
        
        :param chunk: Bytes to add to output buffer.
        :type chunk: String

.. function:: RequestHandler:finish(chunk)

	Writes the chunk to the output buffer and finishes the HTTP request.
	This method should only be called once in one request.
        
        :param chunk: Bytes to add to output buffer.
        :type chunk: String

.. function:: RequestHandler:flush(callback)

	Flushes the current output buffer to the IO stream.
			
	If callback is given it will be run when the buffer has 
	been written to the socket. Note that only one callback flush
	callback can be present per request. Giving a new callback
	before the pending has been run leads to discarding of the
	current pending callback. For HEAD method request the chunk 
	is ignored and only headers are written to the socket.
        
        :param callback: Function to call after the buffer has been flushed.
        :type callback: Function

.. function:: RequestHandler:clear()
	
	Reset all headers, empty write buffer in a request.

.. function:: RequestHandler:add_header(name, value)

	Add the given name and value pair to the HTTP response headers. Raises error if name already exists.

        :param value: Value to add.
        :type value: String

.. function:: RequestHandler:set_header(name, value)

	Set the given name and value pair of the HTTP response headers. If name exists then the value is overwritten.
        
        :param name: Name of value to add.
        :type name: String
        :param value: Value to add.
        :type value: String
        
.. function:: RequestHandler:get_header(name)

	Returns the current value of the given name in the HTTP response headers. Returns nil if not set.
        
        :param name: Name of value to get.
        :type name: String
        :rtype: String or nil

.. function:: RequestHandler:set_status(code)
	
	Set the status code of the HTTP response headers.
	
	:param code: HTTP status code to set.
	:type code: Number

.. function:: RequestHandler:get_status()
	
	Get the curent status code of the HTTP response headers.
	
	:rtype: Number

.. function:: RequestHandler:get_argument(name, default, strip)

	Returns the value of the argument with the given name.
	If default value is not given the argument is considered to be
	required and will result in a 400 Bad Request if the argument
	does not exist.
	
	:param name: Name of the argument to get.
	:type name: String
	:param default: Optional fallback value in case argument is not set.

	:type name: String
	:param strip: Remove whitespace from head and tail of string.
	:type strip: Boolean
        :rtype: Table

.. function:: RequestHandler:redirect(url, permanent)

	Redirect client to another URL. Sets headers and finish request. User can not send data after this.
        
	:param url: The URL to redirect to.
	:type url: String
	:param permanent: Flag this as a permanent redirect or temporary.
	:type permanent: Boolean


HTTPError class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Convinence class for raising errors in ``turbo.web.RequestHandler`` and return a HTTP status code to the client. The error is caught by the RequestHandler and requests is ended. Usage:

::

	local ExampleHandler = class("ExampleHandler", turbo.web.RequestHandler)
	function ExampleHandler:get() 
		local param = self:get_argument("some_key")
		if param ~= "expected" then
			error(turbo.web.HTTPError:new(400))
		else
			self:write("Success!")
		end
	end

.. function:: HTTPError:new(code, message)
	
	Provide code and optional message.
	
	:param code: The HTTP status code to send to send to client.
	:type code: Number
	:param message: Optional message to pass as body in the response.
	:type message: String


StaticFileHandler class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A simple static file handler. All files are cached in memory after initial request. Usage:

::

	local application = turbo.web.Application:new({ 
		{"/static/(.*)$", turbo.web.StaticFileHandler, "/var/www/"},
	})


Application class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Application class is a collection of request handler classes that make together up a web application. Example:

::
	
	local application = turbo.web.Application:new({ 
		{"/static/(.*)$", turbo.web.StaticFileHandler, "/var/www/"},
		{"/$", ExampleHandler},
		{"/item/(%d*)", ItemHandler}
	})

The constructor of this class takes a "map" of URL patterns and their respective handlers. The third element in the table are optional parameters the handler class might have.
E.g the ``turbo.web.StaticFileHandler`` class takes the root path for your static handler. This element could also be another table for multiple arguments.

The first element in the table is the URL that the application class matches incoming request with to determine how to serve it. These URLs simply be a URL or a any kind of Lua pattern.
The ItemHandler URL pattern is an example on how to map numbers from URL to your handlers. Pattern encased in parantheses are used as parameters when calling the request methods in your handlers.

A good read on Lua patterns matching can be found here: http://www.wowwiki.com/Pattern_matching.

.. function:: Application:listen(port, address)
	
	 Starts the HTTP server for this application on the given port.
	 
	 :param port: TCP port to bind server to.
	 :type port: Number
	 :param address: Optional address to bind server to. Use ``turbo.socket.htonl()`` to create address. We use the integer format of the IP.
	 :type address: Number

.. function:: Application:set_server_name(name)

	Sets the name of the server. Used in the response headers.
	
	:param name: The name used in HTTP responses. Default is "Turbo vx.x"
	:type name: String

.. function:: Application:get_server_name()

	Gets the current name of the server.
	:rtype: String


turbo.ioloop namespace
=========================
turbo.ioloop namespace provides a abstracted IO loop, driven typically by Linux Epoll or any other supported poll implemenation. This is the core of Turbo. 
Poll implementations are abstracted and can easily be extended with new variants. 
On Linux Epoll is used and exposed through LuaJIT FFI. The IOLoop class are used by Turbo Web for event driven services.

The inner working are as follows:
	- Set iteration timeout to 3600 milliseconds.
	- If there exists any timeout callbacks, check if they are scheduled to be run. Run them if they are. If timeout callback would be delayed because of too long iteration timeout, the timeout is adjusted.
	- If there exists any interval callbacks, check if they are scheduled to be run. If interval callback would be missed because of too long iteration timeout, the iteration timeout is adjusted.
	- If any callbacks exists, run them. If callbacks add new callbacks, adjust the iteration timeout to 0.
	- If there are any events for sockets file descriptors, run their respective handlers. Else wait for specified interval timeout, or any socket events, jump back to start.
	
Note that because of the fact that the server itself does not know if callbacks block or have a long processing time it cannot guarantee that timeouts and intervals are called on time.
In a perfect world they would be called within a reasonable time of what is specified.

Event types for file descriptors are defined in the ioloop module's namespace:
	``turbo.ioloop.READ``, ``turbo.ioloop.WRITE``, ``turbo.ioloop.PRI``, ``turbo.ioloop.ERROR``

.. function:: ioloop.instance()

        Return the global IO Loop. If none has been created yet, a global IO loop class instance will be created.

	:param sep: String that seperate elements.
	:type sep: String
	:param max: Max elements to split
	:type max: Number
	:param pattern: Separator should be treated as a Lua pattern. Slower.
	:type pattern: Boolean
	:rtype: Table
	
.. function:: join(delimiter, list)

	Join a table into a string.
	
	:param delimiter: Inserts this string between each table element.
