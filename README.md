Turbo.lua Web 
=============
Turbo.lua is a Lua module / toolkit (whatever) for developing web applications in Lua. It is different from all the other Lua HTTP servers out there in that it's modern, fresh, object oriented and easy to modify.
It is written in pure Lua, there are no Lua C modules instead it uses the LuaJIT FFI to do socket and event handling. Users of the Tornado web server will recognize the API offered pretty quick.
If you do not know Lua then do not fear as its probably one of the easiest languages to learn if you know C, Python or Javascript from before.

Turbo.lua is non-blocking and a features a extremely fast light weight web server. The framework is good for REST APIs, traditional HTTP requests and open connections like Websockets requires because of its combination of the raw
power of LuaJIT and its event driven nature.

What sets Turbo.lua apart from the other evented driven servers out there, is that it is the fastest, most scalable and has the smallest footprint of them all. This is thanks to the excellent work done on LuaJIT.

Its main features and design principles are:

- Simple and intuitive API (much like Tornado)

- Good documentation

- No dependencies, except for the Lua interpreter.

- Event driven, asynchronous and threadless design

- Extremely fast with LuaJIT

- Written completely in pure Lua

- Linux Epoll support

- Small footprint

- SSL Support


Object oriented Lua
-------------------
Turbo.lua are programmed in a object oriented fashion. There are many ways to do 
object orientation in Lua, this library uses the Middleclass module. Which is documented
at https://github.com/kikito/middleclass/wiki. Middleclass is being used internally in 
Turbo Web, but is also exposed to the user when inheriting from classes such as the
``turbo.web.RequestHandler`` class. Middleclass is a very lightweight, fast and very
easy to learn if you are used to Python, Java or C++. 

Contributions (important read!)
-----------------------------------------------
Making a event-driven server is hard work! I would really like to get some people working together with me on this project. All contributions are greatly appreciated. Not only in developing the server, but also in documentation, howto's, a official web site and any other field you think YOU can help. The plan is to take on node.js, Tornado and others! If you have any questions then please send them to jhnabrhmsn @ gmail.com .

Dependencies
------------
Turbo Web has dropped support for vanilla Lua because of the decision to drop C modules all together and write all these as LuaJIT FFI modules,
which gives a much better performance. Latest version of LuaJIT can be downloaded here: http://luajit.org/

All of the modules of Turbo Web are made with the class implementation that Middleclass provides <https://github.com/kikito/middleclass>.
